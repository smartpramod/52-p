                <li>Camels are social animals who roam the deserts in search of food and water with up to 30 other individuals. </li> 
                <li>With the exception of rutting males competing for females, camels are very peaceful animals who rarely exhibit 
                aggression.</li>  
                <li>Contrary to popular misconception, camels do not store water in their humps. The humps are actually reservoirs 
                for fatty tissue. Concentrating fat in their humps minimises insulation throughout the rest of the body, thus allowing
                camels to survive in such extreme hot regions.</li>   </div>

                <p><i>Intresting facts of teddy-bear</i></p>
                <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting
                trip.</li>  
                <li>Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting 
                trip in 1902. - The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. She created a soft plush
                with movable arms and legs and a friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903</li>  
                <li>Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a
                sign 'Teddy's bear' and left it in their shop window</li>     </div>
